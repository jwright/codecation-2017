# The Work

Jamie plans on working on two existing products. [Tatsu](http://tatsu.io) and [Callback](http://callback.run). He hopes to complete a few important features for Tatsu. One is the ability to enter your standup early via a direct message. This is nearly complete and just requires using Slack's new menu feature and wrapping it with feature flags. Others are vaction notices and an early version of an asynchronous standup as well as some much overdue bug fixes.

In addition, Jamie hopes to complete and launch Callback. The backend API is nearly complete and most of the work revolves around the front end. He plans on using React for the front end with calls to an API.
